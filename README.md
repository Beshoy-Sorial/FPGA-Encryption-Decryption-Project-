# FPGA Encryption-Decryption Project

## üîê Overview
This project implements a secure **encryption and decryption system** on an **FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array)**. It demonstrates how hardware-level cryptographic operations can be used for high-speed, low-latency secure data processing.

Implemented using **Verilog/VHDL** and tested through simulation and real FPGA board deployment.

## ‚ú® Features
- Supports both **encryption** and **decryption** of data
- Real-time operation using clocked logic
- Parameterizable **encryption key**
- Synchronous reset and clock design
- Functional simulation using ModelSim/ISim
- Synthesized and deployed on FPGA board (e.g., Xilinx/Altera)

## üîß Tools & Requirements
- **HDL Language**: Verilog / VHDL
- **Simulation**: ModelSim / ISim
- **Synthesis Tool**: Xilinx Vivado / Quartus Prime
- **FPGA Board**: [Xilinx Nexys A7 / Cyclone IV]
- Basic understanding of digital design and encryption
